        INTO THE WISH : OUR WISH
    </div>

    <div class="news">
        <h2>🌱 FUJINAGA SAKUYA</h2>

        <p>
            Sakuya is the maknae of <strong>NCT WISH</strong>, born in Japan, standing at the very beginning of his
            journey.
            There is youth in him—not the restless kind, but the quiet kind that listens, learns, and grows.

            He carries himself with <strong>politeness and restraint</strong>, often reserved, often thoughtful. His
            shyness is not a
            weakness; it is part of his sincerity. He speaks softly, moves carefully, and leaves an impression through
            presence rather than volume.

            On stage, Sakuya becomes clearer.
            His movements are <strong> light yet intentional</strong>, his expressions open and honest. Each performance
            shows
            progress—small, visible steps forward—proof of discipline and steady effort. He is not the most forceful
            performer, but he is consistent, and that consistency gives him strength.

            Sakuya represents the core of NCT WISH’s concept:
            <strong>beginnings, and possibility</strong>.
            He feels like someone still discovering who he is, allowing time to shape him rather than rushing the
            answer.

            There is something reassuring about watching him grow.
            Not sudden brilliance, but gradual clarity.
            Not loud confidence,<strong>but quiet certainty forming over time.</strong>
        </p>
        <strong>Sakuya does not bloom to be noticed.
            He blooms because he is ready—
            and with time, his light becomes impossible to overlook 🌸 </strong>
        <p>
            Sakuya reminds us that youth is not just about energy and noise; it is also about patience, learning, and
            becoming. In a world that often demands immediate results, his journey is a testament to the value of
            steady growth and the power of quiet determination.</p>
